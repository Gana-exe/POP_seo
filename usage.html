                believe in good faith that materials available on the Site infringe your copyright, you (or your
                agent) may send Pointone Promotions a notice requesting that Pointone Promotions remove the material
                or block access to it. If you believe in good faith that someone has wrongly filed a notice of
                copyright infringement against you, the DMCA permits you to send Pointone Promotions a
                counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements
                imposed by the DMCA. See https://www.copyright.gov/ for details. Notices and counter-notices should
                be addressed and sent to:<br>
