                    below, Customer shall not have or obtain any rights in such proprietary products, concepts,
                    materials, techniques, methods and know-how, without the prior approval in writing from Pointone

                    secrets, and products that are confidential and of substantial value to the respective party, which
                    value would be impaired if such information were disclosed to third parties ("Confidential
                    Information"). Pointone Promotions and Customer agree that neither shall disclose any Confidential
                    Information to any third party nor shall take every reasonable precaution to protect Confidential

                    Confidential Information that it obtained from the other. The provisions of this section shall not
                    apply to any information which (i) is or becomes available to the public other than by breach of the
                    Agreement by the receiving party, (ii) is rightfully received by receiving party from a third party
                    without confidential imitations, (iii) is independently developed by receiving party's employees
                    without access to Confidential Information, or (iv) is known to the receiving party without any
                    restriction on its use or disclosure prior to first receipt of it from the disclosing party.</p>
                <h4>8. Termination.</h4>
                <p>In the event either party materially breaches or defaults in the performance of any of its
                    obligations hereunder (which breach or default has not been remedied within fifteen (15) days after

                    Customer shall also reimburse Pointone Promotions for all costs incurred to terminate or renegotiate
                    any supplier or sub-contract agreements that Pointone Promotions entered into in connection with
                    this service agreement or for redeployment of Pointone Promotions personnel.</p>
                <h4>9. Expiration.</h4>
                <p>These terms and conditions shall expire upon completion of the Consulting Services and full payment
                    for the Consulting Services, unless earlier terminated in accordance with this section.</p>
                <h4>10. Changes.</h4>
                <p>Should Customer desire to modify or extend the work performed under this Consulting Services Order
                    after it has been signed, the parties will develop and sign written change orders. Prior to
